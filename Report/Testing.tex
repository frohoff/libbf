%TESTING
%
%we want to test robustness and reliability of the library. several areas in particular:
%
%- we want make sure the library is scalable and does not fail on large scale systems. we test on real-world systems, as opposed to toy examples. namely, we test against coreutils (includes stuff like ls, cp, rm, etc.).
%
%we have a suite of regression tests which test the following:
%
%test 1: coreutils\_test32/64
%
%so firstly we want to test the successful disassembly and cfg generation for some real-world example. 
%
%probably want to use valgrind to check for errors. also we can use vtune for profiling although this probably fits into implementation section more
