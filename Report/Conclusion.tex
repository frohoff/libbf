%combine the static techniques we are currently using with dynamic techniques for cfg analysis for a higher level of precision to allow higher code coverage
%use smaller jumps where possible for detours
%If time permits, the most desirable extension is to add dynamic detouring to the library. %We would implement some form of runtime detouring and provide users with the option to %choose between both methods. Another smaller extension which would also be useful is to %allow the library to be invocable through the command-line as well as through the API (as %seen with ELFsh).
