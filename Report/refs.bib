	year = {2010},
	abstract = {Third-party software is often distributed only in binary form. For software engineering or security considerations, it is important to be able to analyze binaries. One fundamental obstacle to perform binary analysis is the lack of precise control flow information. Existing techniques to construct control flow of binaries are either static or dynamic. Traditional static techniques usually disassemble a program’s binary image statically and build the control flow graph from the assembly-level representation of the program. They are limited in precision because of difficulty in statically resolving indirect branches. Dynamic techniques, on the other hand, suffer from poor coverage and scalability. Hybrid techniques based on combined dynamic and symbolic path exploration can be used to improve code coverage, but still suffer from poor coverage and scalability because they rely on expensive constraint solving to generate},
